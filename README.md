- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HenjiShip
 I'm a full stack engineer with a bachelors in computer science. 
 For me, organization is key to creating a well oiled machine of a website and I love creating clean reusable components. 
 It's just really satisfying. After graduating, I worked on further improving my front end skills with the backend technologies using NodeJS to create REST APIs and MongoDB for data basing. 
 This allows me to adapt to any kind of team so in a way, I'm kind of like that stick shape in Tetris that you always want. I can rotate to fit a bunch of teams and break down problems.
